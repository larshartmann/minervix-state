# Mission Statement

My mission statement is my North Star in life. It is reviewed to maintain alignment, not rewritten in response to circumstance.

## Why

I solve real problems for real people in the real world.
 
## Mission Statement

I commit to acting deliberately in the world by taking responsibility for long-term outcomes, not just short-term intentions.
I choose to engage with real problems, affecting real people, under real constraints, and to make decisions that remain defensible over time.
I accept that capacity is finite, that growth requires friction, and that meaningful responsibility sometimes requires restraint rather than action.
I refuse to let short-term pressure, convenience, or approval distort long-term responsibility, or to externalize the cost of my choices onto others.
When circumstances change or systems no longer support my principles, I will redesign the structure of my commitments rather than erode my integrity.
Across changing contexts, I seek to act in ways that preserve human capability, shared resilience, and continuity of self—moving deliberately rather than by default.

## Values (How I act)

- Stewardship - Take responsibility for long-term outcomes
- Intentionality - Design structure instead of relying on vigilance
- Deliberateness - Act deliberately rather than reactively
- Realism - Respect real constraints and finite capacity
- Truthfulness - Make reality visible through systems and models
- Empowerment - Enable others without removing accountability

## Meta Principle

When reality persistently violates my principles, I redesign the system—not my integrity.

## Guiding Principles

1. I act in ways that remain defensible over time.
	I evaluate decisions by their long-term consequences, not by short-term relief, approval, or convenience.
2. I do not externalize the cost of my choices onto those closest to me.
	I account for hidden costs in time, energy, attention, and emotional load, and I refuse outcomes that are funded by silent sacrifice from others.
3. I treat capacity as a real constraint, not a moral failure.
	I design commitments I can sustain and choose boundaries over resentment, guilt, or performative presence.
4. I allow productive friction when it builds long-term capability.
	I resist premature smoothing of discomfort when learning, resilience, or independence is at stake.
5. I move up the abstraction ladder when local context becomes distorted or toxic.
	I define goals and decision rules that remain valid beyond conflict, emotion, or politics.
6. I preserve continuity of self across life phases.
	I deliberately protect long-term identity, relationships, and goals from slow erosion caused by short-term absorption.
7. I prefer systems and foresight over improvisation when stakes are long-term.
	I invest in structure, stewardship, and preventive work to protect future optionality and resilience.

## Operationalization

- Is this a one-off strain, or a pattern?
+ If it is a pattern, what must be redesigned?

## Important Contexts - evolve over years

In my current context, I apply my mission deliberately—aware that my choices affect others and shape the world we share.

- Examples (today):
  - Marriage
  - Children
  - Work
  - Family economics
  - Enduring friendships
  - Health / energy (if it becomes explicit later)
- Examples (possible future):
  - Aging parents
  - Reduced work intensity
  - Personal IP / research
  - Grandparenthood
  - Geographic relocation
